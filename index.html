	     <h2>Let's live off the land!</h2>
		 <p>As most of us know life sometimes sends us down an unexpected path. The financial uproar in 2008 and resulting personal repercussions sent my wife and I on one such journey.
		    After the dust settled in early 2012, we decided to check out from the ratrace and try living a "simpler" l The ife. One asset we were able to maintain possession of was some 
		    recreational property in Southern Missouri. Forty three wooded acres with a small springfed creek seemed like the perfect getaway spot</p>
		 <h2>From campsite to homestead.</h2>
		 <p>We owned the property for about 10 years when we decided to make it our permanent residence. Fortunately, in that time I was able to construct a tiny (12' x 16') cabin where we stayed
		    during our weekend trips down. Unfortunately, it was not in a state for full time occupancy. No running water, no electrical service and the "facilities" were comprised of a
			simple composting toilet: a five gallon bucket with a box built around it and a civilized authentic toilet seat to top it off. Just use it as required and dump a generous amount of 
			sawdust on top.</p>
		 <p>The first priority was to create some extra living space. Thankfully my profession was carpentry for a 10 year period. I was able to build a small kitchen addition along with an equally small
		    bedroom/bathroom area. The entire living quarters was comprised of approximately 400 square feet. A tiny house before tiny houses were cool and plenty of space for 2 people. 
		 </p>	
		 <h2>Off grid by necessity.</h2>
		 <p>One of the more difficult aspects of daily life in the beginning of our experiment was the lack of utilities. We were somewhat prepared, though. Ninety watts of solar panels, two
            deep cycle marine batteries, and a 1200 watt true sine wave inverter went a long way to make things a bit more convenient. It was plenty of juice to power some led lights, a 
			laptop and charge a cell phone. Luckily for us we also met a very friendly neighbor from up the road a piece (local jargon). She was litterally a life saver by allowing us to fill up on as
			as much water as we needed. It required quite a few trips every day to get enough water for us...and the horse. Did I mention the horse? More on that later.</p>
		 <h2>Now we're cooking.</h2>
		 <p>Six months without the modern utility convenience can certainly make one appreciate the things they may have taken for granted. We finally saved enough (with a little assistance from mom) to 
		    upgrade the homestead. First came the well and a small generator. I had hauled plenty of water for an entire lifetime in my opinion. A couple weeks later we got electric hooked up. Thankfully 
			another very friendly neighbor helped us put in the wiring from the power pole to the house. A backhoe was way better than digging a 175 foot ditch by hand in the rocky (verry rocky) Ozarks soil.
			Things were definitely looking up.</p>
		 <h2>Three cats, two dogs, and a horse: what else do we need?... A mini mule of course!</h2>
